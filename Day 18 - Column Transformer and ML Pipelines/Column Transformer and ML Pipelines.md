#  Column Transformer and ML Pipelines

<br>


## **Column Transformer:**

Column Transformer is a tool in scikit-learn that helps us work with numerical and categorical data separately. It allows us to create and apply different transformations to specific columns of our data. 
To use Column Transformer, we need to provide a transformer object and specify the transformations we want to apply to each column. These transformations are passed in a tuple along with the column we want to apply them to.

## **Machine Learning Pipelines:**

Machine learning pipelines are like a series of connected steps, where the result of each step is passed to the next one. Itâ€™s similar to how in neural networks, the output of one layer becomes the input for the next layer. Just like a pipeline carries water from one place to another, a machine learning pipeline carries data through each step until the final output is achieved. By using machine learning pipelines, the length of production code also reduces.
